I am Gaetano Perrone, a compiuter science passionate about software development, cybersecurity, and research.


### üíª Development skills
I really love developing software, and I usually realize security tools for my work and researches. I have developed [Docker Security Playground](https://github.com/DockerSecurityPlayground/DSP), a microservices-based framework for the study of Network Security and Penetration Test techniques.

#### Known programming languages: 
* Python 
  *  Poetry
  * Typer
  * Flask
  * Django

* JavaScript (NodeJS for back-end)
  * NodeJS
  * Express
  * React
  * Angular

* Java
* C, C++
* Golang
* Ruby


#### Open-source projects
- [DockerSecurityPlayground](https://github.com/DockerSecurityPlayground/DSP): Docker Security Playground is an application that allows you to manage and create intentionally virtualized container-based environments. Based on AngularJS and NodeJS.  

- [docker-js](https://github.com/giper45/docker-js): A nodeJS CLI library to manage Docker containers and images.  
- [HOUDINI](https://github.com/cybersecsi/houdini): a curated list of Network Security related Docker Images for Network Intrusion purposes. Front-end developed in React and Tailwind.  
- [python-cherrytree-generator](https://github.com/giper45/python-cherrytree-generator): Cherry-tree is a wonderful tool used to take notes. It is commonly used during Penetration Testing activities. This project is a simple Python API that creates DTD cherry tree files (basically, XML files). It can be useful to use cherrytree in automation steps.
